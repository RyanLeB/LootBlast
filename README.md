# LootBlast

This was made as a final project in one of my classes, the purpose was to show off simple game mechanics but i decided to take it further and make it into a game. 

This was about a full week or two of work and is meant to really showcase what I learned in a year. :)

Any suggestions on any changes is appreciated!
